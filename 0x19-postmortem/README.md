Outage Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: January 21, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
End Time: January 21, 2024, 3:00 PM UTC
Impact:
The user authentication service was completely down for approximately 25% of our users.
Users experienced inability to log in, leading to a disruption in accessing critical features.
Customer complaints spiked by 30%.
Timeline:

Detection Time:
January 21, 2024, 10:15 AM UTC
Detection Method:
Monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden surge in failed authentication requests.
Actions Taken:
Investigated backend servers, assuming a database connectivity issue.
Checked network configurations and firewall settings.
Initially suspected a DDoS attack and implemented mitigations.
Misleading Paths:
Initially focused on the database layer, wasting valuable time.
Investigated recent code deployments without concrete evidence of issues.
Explored network latency without identifying any significant problems.
Escalation:
Escalated to the DevOps and Database teams after initial investigations proved inconclusive.
Joint efforts to isolate the issue led to escalation to senior systems engineers.
Resolution:
Identified an issue with the load balancer misconfiguration affecting authentication requests.
Adjusted load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
System returned to normal operation after load balancer adjustments.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
Load balancer was not distributing traffic uniformly, causing increased load on specific backend servers and subsequent service degradation.
Resolution:
Modified load balancer configurations to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
Conducted thorough testing to ensure the load balancer adjustments did not introduce new issues.
Implemented additional monitoring to promptly detect and alert on load balancer irregularities.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Enhanced documentation for load balancer configurations to prevent future misconfigurations.
Implemented automated tests for load balancing configurations as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Scheduled regular load testing scenarios to proactively identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Established better communication channels for cross-team collaboration during incidents.
Tasks:
Update load balancer documentation with best practices.
Incorporate load balancing tests into the automated testing suite.
Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire web stack to identify and address potential single points of failure.
Organise a cross-team incident response training session to improve collaboration during critical incidents.

😡 Complaints flooded in like a dam burst, rising by 30%.
Timeline:


Detection Time:
🕵️‍♂️ January 21, 2024, 10:15 AM UTC
Detection Method:
🚨 Monitoring alert crashed the party due to a sudden influx of failed authentication requests.
Actions Taken:
🔍 Investigated backend servers, thinking they were hiding in a digital Bermuda Triangle.
🕵️‍♂️ Checked network configurations, hoping to find a secret passage.
🤔 Suspected a DDoS attack and put on our cyber superhero capes.
Misleading Paths:
🧐 Got lost in the database labyrinth initially, chasing ghosts.
🚀 Explored recent code deployments like cosmic archaeologists, found nothing.
🌐 Investigated network latency, only to find a metaphorical black hole.
Escalation:
🚨 Escalated to the DevOps and Database teams like a distress signal in the night.
🦸‍♂️ Super senior systems engineers joined the quest, armed with debugging spells.
Resolution:
🕵️‍♂️ Unveiled the mischievous culprit – a load balancer misconfiguration!
🔄 Adjusted load balancer settings to bring back harmony to the digital kingdom.
🚀 System returned to normal, users rejoiced like they found the golden ticket.
Root Cause and Resolution:


Root Cause:
🤖 The load balancer got confused and played favorites, causing chaos in the authentication realm.
🧙‍♂️ Adjusted load balancer configurations to be fair and just, like a digital Dumbledore.
Resolution:
🚨 Modified load balancer settings to ensure a balanced distribution of magic among backend servers.
🧪 Conducted thorough testing, ensuring the spell worked without unintended side effects.
📡 Implemented extra monitoring to catch mischievous load balancer shenanigans.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:


Improvements/Fixes:
